# Patchbay: family design system

Shared by `a0-plugin-durable`, `a0-plugin-glitchtip`, `a0-plugin-notion`, `a0-plugin-device-sync` and `a0-plugin-jev-compact`. This file is identical in all five repos above the per-plugin section at the bottom. Change it in all five or in none.

Status: proposal, written 2026-10-10. The owner signs off logos.

## 1. Direction

**Patchbay.** An Agent Zero plugin is a module that seats into a host: a `plugin.yaml`, a settings panel, an API route, an extension hook. A patchbay is the honest picture of that: labelled sockets, short cables, nothing decorative. The family looks like instrument-rack labelling. Cool paper, near-black ink, one teal signal colour that means "this is live or selected", monospace for anything a machine said, system sans for anything a person reads.

The memorable move: **every plugin is a 32-unit glyph seated in the same 64-unit socket frame, with one filled corner "pin"**. Five repos, one silhouette, five different insides.

## 2. Research, reference lock and decision ledger

Refero MCP was not connected on this machine (see `design-research.md` Track 1). Research ran on the local `awesome-design-md` analyses plus the bundled refero craft references, which is the fallback the skill allows.

References studied (all in `awesome-design-md/design-md/<name>/DESIGN.md`):

| Reference | Used for | Rejected from it |
|---|---|---|
| linear.app | surface ladder (canvas, surface, hairline), accent scarcity, tight type scale | lavender accent, near-black-only canvas, custom display face |
| hashicorp | one system holding several product identities | per-product accent colours (would break "reads as a set") |
| raycast | key-cap chips, command-palette density, hairline-only borders | gradient hero stripes, Inter ss03 |
| sentry | error-tool voice: plain status words, severity as text first | violet/lime palette, illustrated mascot style |
| warp | monospace-forward terminal framing | glossy gradient chrome |

Reference lock:

```text
Primary direction: Linear's surface ladder and accent scarcity, translated to a light-first palette with a dark twin.
Preserve: (1) one accent only; (2) 1px hairlines instead of shadows; (3) monospace labels; (4) flat fills, no gradients; (5) the same mark frame in every repo.
Borrow only: Raycast's key-cap chip for status tokens; HashiCorp's one-system-many-products idea, carried by glyph not colour.
Role rules: signal = live/selected/primary action only. warn = degraded/failed only. Never use signal as a decorative fill.
Media strategy: code-native SVG only. No raster, no stock, no generated imagery.
Reject: indigo/violet, glassmorphism, gradient text, cream+terracotta "calm editorial", drop-shadow cards, emoji as icons, decorative serif word swaps.
Token commitments: paper/ink/signal as in the front matter; 8px frame radius, 4px controls; hairline 1px.
```

Decision ledger:

| Decision | Source | Role to preserve | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single teal accent for the whole family | linear.app accent scarcity; reject hashicorp per-product colour | live/selected only | five plugins must read as one set; colour is spent on state, not brand |
| Light-first with dark twin | refero default, overridden by a0's own dark UI | n/a | Agent Zero's web UI is commonly dark; every token has a dark pair |
| Monospace for labels and headings | warp, raycast terminal framing | machine-voice text | plugin surfaces are logs, ids, paths and config keys |
| System sans for body | craft rule: do not ship a webfont inside a plugin panel | prose only | zero font loading inside a0's iframe panels |
| Hairlines not shadows | linear.app, raycast | separation | panels live inside another app's chrome; shadows fight it |
| Socket frame + corner pin mark | patchbay concept (user plugin model) | brand mark only | gives five different glyphs a shared silhouette |
| Warn is orange-brown, not red | craft: avoid red/green only status | failure/degraded | colour-blind safe against teal; AA on both canvases |

## 3. Tokens and contrast

Light:

| Pair | Foreground | Background | Ratio | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ink on paper | #0F1720 | #F4F6F7 | 16.65:1 | body, headings |
| ink-muted on paper | #4A5663 | #F4F6F7 | 6.91:1 | secondary text |
| signal on paper | #00766E | #F4F6F7 | 5.08:1 | links, live state |
| on-signal on signal | #F4F6F7 | #00766E | 5.08:1 | primary button text |
| warn on paper | #A33A00 | #F4F6F7 | 6.13:1 | error text |
| ink on surface | #0F1720 | #E6EBED | 15.01:1 | panels |
| ink-muted on surface | #4A5663 | #E6EBED | 6.23:1 | panel secondary |

Dark:

| Pair | Foreground | Background | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| night-ink on night | #E8EEF1 | #0C1116 | 16.19:1 |
| night-ink-muted on night | #9AA7B2 | #0C1116 | 7.72:1 |
| night-signal on night | #3FD3C4 | #0C1116 | 10.23:1 |
| on-night-signal on night-signal | #0C1116 | #3FD3C4 | 10.23:1 |
| night-warn on night | #FF9F6B | #0C1116 | 9.41:1 |
| night-ink-muted on night-surface | #9AA7B2 | #161D24 | 6.92:1 |

All text pairs clear WCAG AA (4.5:1). Hairlines are non-text and only need 3:1 when they are the sole boundary of an input; inputs use a 1px `ink-muted` border instead of `hairline`.

## 4. Type

- Display and headings: JetBrains Mono (falls back to `ui-monospace`). 28/18 px, weights 700/600.
- Body: the system sans stack, 15 px / 1.55. Plugin panels render inside Agent Zero, so no webfont is loaded.
- Labels and chips: mono 12 px, +0.04em tracking, uppercase only for the status chip.
- Code and ids: mono 13 px. Task ids, trace ids, page ids and peer names are always mono.
- Use `text-wrap: balance` on headings and `text-wrap: pretty` on README prose blocks.

## 5. Glyph grammar (marks and in-panel icons)

All marks, and all in-panel icons, follow one construction. The build script `assets/brand/family-build.py` generates them.

- Canvas 64 x 64. Frame: rounded square, outer edge 4..60 (56 x 56), outer corner radius 8, stroke 6, no fill.
- Pin: a filled signal-colour block 14 x 14 occupying the bottom-right corner of the frame (x 46..60, y 46..60, outer corner radius 8 so it continues the frame outline). It is the "seated" indicator and appears in every mark. In-panel icons drop the pin.
- Glyph box: 28 x 28 at x 16..44, y 16..44 (offset up-left to balance the pin). Strokes are `ink`, width 4, butt caps, mitre joins, centrelines kept inside 19..41 so outer edges stay in the box. Straight segments only; no curves except the frame corner.
- At 16 px the 6-unit frame renders at 1.5 px and the 4-unit glyph stroke at 1 px. Every glyph is checked at 16, 32 and 128 px on the family sheet.
- One glyph per plugin, one metaphor each (see the per-plugin section). Glyphs never reuse the signal colour except the shared pin.
- Wordmark: the plugin name in JetBrains Mono Bold, converted to outlines, set to the right of the mark at the cap height of the frame. Name form: `a0-plugin-<name>` in `ink`, with the `a0-plugin-` prefix in `ink-muted`.

## 6. Motion

- Only state changes move. A status chip crossfades in 120 ms; a panel section expands in 160 ms with `ease-out`.
- No looping animation, no skeleton shimmer longer than 1 s, no motion on load.
- Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`: replace every transition with an instant change.
- The pin never animates.

## 7. Surfaces (family-wide)

| Surface | Exists in family | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| README | all five | logo + wordmark top, one sentence, install, how it works, status |
| Agent Zero settings panel (`settings_sections: external`) | all five | one card per config group, hairline borders, mono key names, signal only on the enabled toggle |
| API (`api/*.py` JSON) | all five | `{ok, error}` envelope, no UI |
| Agent-facing tool output | notion, jev-compact | plain text, ids in mono-style backticks, no emoji |
| Log lines | all five | `[plugin] verb noun id=... ` one line, no colour codes |
| Social card | all five | SVG, 1280 x 640, paper or night canvas, mark left, name right |

Status chip tokens (Raycast key-cap borrow): 2px radius, 1px hairline, mono 12 px label. States: `LIVE` (signal text), `IDLE` (ink-muted), `FAILED` (warn text). Never colour alone: the word is always present.

## 8. Do and don't

Do: spend signal only on live/selected/primary; keep every mark on the 64 grid; ship paper and night variants of every asset.
Don't: add a second accent; add gradients or shadows to marks; use emoji or stock icon sets; change a glyph's stroke weight to "fit".

## 9. Known gaps

- No Refero live styles were read (MCP not connected); the lock rests on local analyses.
- JetBrains Mono is not bundled; panels fall back to `ui-monospace`. Verify the fallback in a real a0 panel before the next design pass.
- Marks and wordmarks are proposals pending owner sign-off.

## Plugin surfaces: device-sync

Glyph: two opposing arrows, one pointing right on the upper line and one pointing left on the lower line (path `M19 24H41M36 19L41 24L36 29 M41 36H19M24 31L19 36L24 41` in the 28-unit glyph box). Rationale: sync here is symmetric (push, pull, bidirectional), so the mark is two arrows going opposite ways. Straight segments and 4-unit strokes only, per section 5. It stays legible at 16 px because there are only two strokes and two arrowheads, and neither arrowhead is closed.

Real surfaces, taken from the code:

- **Settings panel** (`settings_sections: external`; no webui code exists yet, a0 renders from `default_config.yaml`). Keys: `enabled`, `sync_token`, `peers_file`, `peer_port`, `auto_sync_interval_s`, `http_timeout_s`, `memory_backend`, `memory_dir`. Rule: `sync_token` is a secret field and never echoed; the panel shows `token_set` as a status chip (`LIVE` when set, `IDLE` when not). `enabled` is the only toggle that takes signal colour.
- **API** (POST, `{ok, error}` envelope, bearer token): `/api/plugins/device_sync/settings_export`, `settings_import`, `chats_export`, `chats_import`, `memory_export`, `memory_import`, `peers`, `sync_now`. Import endpoints report errors in-band as `{"ok": false}` at HTTP 200, as documented in the README.
- **Sync result** (`SyncResult.to_dict`, returned by `sync_now`): per-peer results with `errors` and `settings_conflicts`. Conflict keys are shown as mono key names; a conflict count above zero uses the `FAILED` chip text only when a leg errored, otherwise `IDLE`.
- **Log lines**: the plugin logs structured payloads per peer (`peer`, `error`, result dict) and logger `a0.device_sync`. Target form is the family rule `[device-sync] verb noun peer=<name>`; the code does not yet emit that form.
- **Peer names and ctxids** are always mono.
- **Agent-facing tool output**: none. The plugin has no agent tool.
- **README and social card**: wordmark top, one sentence, status line, diagram.
